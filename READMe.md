# Blogging Website

I'm excited to introduce my latest side project: a state-of-the-art blogging website designed for both writers and readers. Here’s a quick rundown of the tech stack that powers this platform:

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### 🌟 Frontend: React

I built the frontend with React for a fast and dynamic user experience. Its component-based architecture ensures reusability and maintainability.

### ☁️ Backend: Cloudflare Workers

The backend runs on Cloudflare Workers, providing low-latency, serverless performance that scales effortlessly with traffic.

### 🌀 State Management: Recoil

For state management, I chose Recoil. It simplifies state management in React with an intuitive and flexible API, making state sharing across components seamless.

### 🔒 Validation & Type Inference: Zod + TypeScript

I use Zod for robust data validation and TypeScript for type inference. This combination ensures type-safe schemas and reduces bugs.

### 💡 Language: TypeScript

The entire project is written in TypeScript, adding static typing to JavaScript for improved code quality and developer productivity.

### 🛠️ ORM: Prisma

Prisma ORM simplifies database interactions with an intuitive, type-safe client and efficient connection pooling.

### 🗄️ Database: Postgres

Postgres is my database of choice for its reliability and advanced features, providing a solid foundation for data management.
